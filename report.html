        <p> <h3>DAY 1</h3> 
On the first day, introducing ourselves to the school, we met a very energetic and humble headmaster named Mr. Daiye Emmanuel Love and his unique and friendly staff who welcomed us warmly. We introduced ourselves and they gave us their names as follows; Mr. Dzokoto Delali, Madam Patience Amenu, Madam Elizabeth Agbena, Mr. Courage, Madam Simpri Esinam (the assistant headmistress) and other five of the teaching staff. 
We were again given the school history that Akatsi A.R.S. (Apostle Revelational Society) is a single stream school which was first established as community-based school by A.R.S. church in the year 1948 and became a model school in 1952. The primary and JHS were registered in the year 1998 and 2003 respectively with eleven classroom blocks and with a staff common tree. The school, in 2016 and 2019 achieved 100% in their B.E.C.E and now with the student population of 546, 20 teachers and 6 canteen attendants.
The primary 4 to 6 classrooms were built by MTN whereby PTA also gives supports to the school. The school has 8 toilets, urinal, canteen, with no library or ICT lab but has 15 desk RLJ laptops which are not in use.
I happen to observe JHS 1.
	On the first day our main topic of focus was, preparation to teach in school 3: Induction.
We recorded that, the school has a culture of going to assembly at 7:40am and closes at 2:30pm. The school participates in circuit base quiz due to the presence of COVID-19 19 and assignments are always given after teaching and many other of their cultures.
The key educational policies of the school include: sexual harassment policy, inclusive education policy which welcomes all kinds of learners and also, they practice gender equality. 
Talking about GESI (Gender Equality and Social Inclusion) issues, the school teachers have been trained to welcome both gender views in the classroom activities and the school at large with the help of GESI policy. 
During the ICT class the teacher used his mobile phone to search pictures of different metals and used other drawing tools to draw them. 
According to the assessment components of the year 3 STS, learners can be assessed by; 
<ul>
  <li>How much knowledge mastery they have over a topic? </li>
  <li>	How proficient they are</li>	
  <li>Their level of skill demonstration </li>
  <li>And how they can solve problems by creating products.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>		
</ul> 
I have learnt from the induction regarding GESI and the integration of ICT into teaching and learning that, <br>
a.	ICT tools help to remove boredom when teaching and learning thereby increasing learners desire of participation. <br>
b.	ICT tools are used to demonstrate different strategies in teaching which gives better explanations to a learner about a topic. <br>
c.	The use of ICT makes learners to see everyone in the class as equal to participate. <br>

 <h3>DAY 2</h3>
On the following week which was Monday 7th January 2022, we held the topic leadership qualities in the classroom to observe. 
In the process of teaching and learning in the classroom, I observe the teacher demonstrate hardworking qualities in controlling the misconducts of learners. He listens closely to learners’ questions and answers and he also demonstrate mastery over the topic by teaching without reading from the textbook. 
To ensure that classroom rules and regulations are being implemented, the teacher advised learners to respect the views of others, raise hands before they ask or answer a question. Applaud was given as a form of reinforcement and punishment are as well given to those that will litter the classroom.
The knowledge I have acquire from the leadership in the classroom is that, given opportunities to learners to lead their various groups promotes law and order. Also paying attention to learner’s views when teaching and learning helps learners to have confidence in both the teacher and the lesson. 
And I will apply this new knowledge by,  <br>
1.	Mentioning learners who raise their hands to ask or answer question rather than those that will be shouting “Sir, Sir”. <br>
2.	For free and safe movement in the class I will order my learners to arrange their tables and desks to be in uniform <br>
3.	I will be punctual and neat and also look-out fir the shy learners and give those that have leadership desires the chance to lead small groups. <br>

 <h3>DAY 3</h3>
On 14th January, which was the final observation for the semester, we observed the topic; achieve set targets on STS.
On that day, I recorded 5 different NTS targets that I was expected to achieve in the semester and how they can be achieved on my own and with the help of others. The targets are; <br>
1.	To become creative and innovative in the classroom <br>
2.	To promote gender inclusivity in the classroom <br>
3.	To again develop the spirit of enquiry learning <br>
4.	Have passion for teaching and leadership <br>
5.	And finally engage in lifelong learning <br>
The way I will achieve it by myself is that, I will prepare my lesson with different teaching strategies ahead of time in order to have mastery over the topic and again be decent while I include ICT tools in my teaching.
With the help of others, I will make learning learner centered, promote equal participation of both gender and welcome the views of my colleagues and students.
In setting targets for myself, I have learnt that I am the role model of the class and must actively involve my learners to participate fully and also learnt that teaching and learning becomes ineffective when I did not prepare my lessons well before going to the class.
 For other people I learnt that teaching and learning cannot be effective without learners’ participation whereby boys and girls can all participate equally in the class. 
In order to apply my knowledge concerning GESI responsiveness in my teaching, I have learnt that;
1.	I must not be gender bias toward a particular gender. 
2.	I must include gender inclusive teaching strategies to engineer collaborative learning 
3.	And also dress decent to avoid harassment
